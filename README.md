# Retirement-Financial-Planner
Script that outputs an adjustable disposable income viewer depending on multiple varying retirement parameters, such as:

-Current salary

-Pensions

-Multiple sources of income

-Taxation

-Retirement age

-Real return on current pot


Accounts for a decrease in spending of disposable income as one ages, as a result of reduced activity. Can be viewed with an exponentially decaying mode:
